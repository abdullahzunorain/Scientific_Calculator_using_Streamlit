   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   You can use `pip` to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the Streamlit server using the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run scientific_calculator_app.py
   ```

4. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `https://scientific-calculator-4.streamlit.app/` to view the application.

## Usage

1. Enter the first and second numbers in the designated input fields.
2. Select the desired operation by clicking the corresponding button.
3. The result will be displayed in a dedicated result box below the buttons.
4. For trigonometric functions, the app will automatically generate a plot for the selected function, indicating the value at the specified angle.

## Example

- To add two numbers, enter the numbers and click the "âž• Add" button.
- To visualize the sine function, enter an angle and click the "sin" button. A plot will be generated showing the sine wave along with the selected angle.
